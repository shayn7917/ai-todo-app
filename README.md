AI-assisted To-Do List (Streamlit)
=================================

This is a small To-Do list Streamlit app that includes a local, rule-based 'AI helper' that suggests priority, estimated time, and tags based on the task description.
No external APIs are called â€” the "AI" is a simple heuristic function so you can run it offline locally.

To run:
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the app: `streamlit run app.py`
3. Open the URL shown by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501)
